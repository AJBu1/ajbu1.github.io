    <section>
    <h2> Welcome!</h2>
<p> I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at Rutgers University.  I currently plan to graduate at the end of this academic year.  
 I have been the president of <a href="https://rutgers.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/gradient" title="GRADient website" target="_blank">GRADient</a>, the LGBTQ professional and graduate student association at Rutgers University, since June 2020. During this time, I successfully applied to make GRADient a recognized Graduate Student Organization. </p>
</p>
<p> I graduated magna cum laude from Boston College with a B.A. in mathematics and a minor in philosophy, and  I was awarded Departmental Honors in Mathematics. I also took courses in the Lynch School of Education.
I was inducted into the Order of the Cross and Crown, an honor society that recognizes students who both achieved academic excellence and had an important impact on the community through service and leadership.
