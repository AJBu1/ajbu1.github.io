<P>

Motzkin paths are simple yet important combinatorial objects. In this paper, we consider families of Motzkin paths with restrictions on 
peak heights, valley heights, upward-run lengths, downward-run lengths, and flat-run lengths. This paper presents two fully automated methods for 
enumerating the paths of such families. The first method uses numeric dynamic programming. While this method often times works, it can be slow and 
may not work for larger problems. The second method uses symbolic dynamic programming to solve such problems. 
These methods are implemented in the maple packages accompanying this article.
