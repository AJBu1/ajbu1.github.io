In this paper, we describe how to find the generating function for the sum of the areas under
Motzkin paths of length n through a method that uses dynamical programming, which we show
can be expanded for paths with any given set of steps that start and end at height zero and never
have a negative height. We then explore the case where, instead of a set of steps, we are given
the quadratic functional equation 
<center>f (x, q) = P (x, q) + Q(x, q)f (x, q) + R(x, q)f (x, q)f (qx, x). </center>
We
present a fully automated method for finding perturbation expansions of the solutions f (x, q) to
such quadratic functional equations and demonstrate this method using Motzkin paths. More
importantly, we combine computer algebra with calculus to automatically find 
<center> d^k/dq^k[f(x,q)]|_{q=1}</center>
explicitly expressed in terms of radicals. We use Dyck and Motzkin paths to exemplify how this
can be used to find explicit generating functions for the sum of the areas under such paths and
for the sum of a given power of the areas.
